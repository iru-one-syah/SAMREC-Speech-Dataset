# The SAMREC Dataset

The SAMREC dataset is a set of audio recordings made with the SAMREC 2500R dummy head microphones. 20-speeches data were recorded in the full azimuth range, 0 to 360. The initial purpose of this dataset was to allow for realistic studies of binaural sound localization with front-back discrimination capability in reverberant environments.
