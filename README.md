# The SAMREC Dataset

The SAMREC dataset is a set of audio recordings made with the [SAMREC Type 2500R dummy head microphones](https://shop.miyaji.co.jp/SHOP/ka-r-021716-ay04.html). 20-speech sounds were recorded in the full azimuth range, 0 elevations. The main purpose of this dataset was to allow for realistic studies of binaural sound localization with front-back discrimination capability in reverberant environments.
