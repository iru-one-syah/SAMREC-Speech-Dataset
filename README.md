# The SAMREC Dataset

The SAMREC dataset is a set of audio speech recordings made with the SAMREC Type 2500R dummy head microphones. 20-speech sounds were recorded in the full azimuth range, 0 to 360. The main purpose of this dataset was to allow for realistic studies of binaural sound localization with front-back discrimination capability in reverberant environments.
